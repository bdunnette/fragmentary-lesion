#  Research Guidelines

In an effort to create an environment that fosters opportunities for residents
to do research, the Department of Laboratory Medicine and Pathology has set
aside funds for resident research. Deadlines for application are announced
twice yearly, usually in February and August. Applications are reviewed by the
department's Research Advisory Committee and forwarded to Dr. Furcht for
approval. The mechanism for applying for the funds is as follows:

  * Write a short research plan (two-three pages total) to include (1) specific aims, (2) background and significance, (3) research design and methods, and (4) timeframe for completion.
  * Design a budget and budget justification to support the request. Most awards are in the $2,000-$2,500 range and are for one year of support; personnel costs are NOT allowed.
  * Provide a letter from your research mentor that indicates s/he supports this project and has the space to accommodate your work.
  * Obtain approval from the Institutional Research Board (626-5654;[http://www.research.umn.edu/subjects/](http://www.research.umn.edu/subjects/)) if you are using vertebrate animals or human subjects in your research. Provide a copy of IRB approval with your proposal.
  * If a proposal is funded, a final report is required at the conclusion of the project.
