Andrew Nelson, MD, PhD

![](../sites/default/files/nelson_andrew.jpg)

Medical School:

University of Colorado, Denver, 2010

Research Interests:

My work has focused on the molecular regulation of BRCA1 and BRCA2 protein
expression and function in response to hormone signaling (estrogen and IGF-1).
We have identified that activated AKT phosphorylates BRCA1, which stabilizes
BRCA1 protein expression and promotes its DNA repair function. Additional work
has described hormone-responsive pathways that lead to a similar stabilization
of BRCA2 protein through cyclin-dependent kinase activity. These findings have
led to the development of several novel translational concepts for the
diagnostic and therapeutic care of patients with either hereditary or sporadic
breast/ovarian cancers.
