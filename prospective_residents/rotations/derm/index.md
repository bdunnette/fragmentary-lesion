Introduction

Prior to beginning their subspecialty rotations in Anatomic Pathology, the
residents learn how to gross various specimens and sign out microscopic cases
in at least one general Surgical Pathology rotation.

#### Goals

The goals of the rotation in Dermatopathology are:

  1. To be competent at evaluating and signing out specimens of skin containing basic inflammatory disease, cutaneous tumors, and pigmented lesions.
  2. To expose the resident to laboratory procedures, immunopathology and molecular diagnostic techniques involved with Dermatopathology specimens.
  3. Develop a systematic approach to the pathological analysis of the skin, including gross examination and dissection with selection of appropriate sections for microscopic examination.
  4. Be able to describe the gross and microscopic anatomy and pathology of the skin with appropriate terminology and conclusion.
  5. To provide the resident an increased number and wider variety of cases.
  6. To obtain a level of skill examining basic specimens of skin to allow the resident to adequately interpret them while on other Surgical Pathology rotations.

#### Objectives

  1. **Patient Care:** Following completion of the rotation in Dermatopathology, the resident should be able to competently perform the following patient care activities:  

    1. Be able to perform a chart review to assess pertinent findings related to the patient's condition and diagnosis.
    2. Be able to review any pertinent laboratory data and interpret the findings related to the patient's condition and diagnosis.
    3. Be able to discuss the case with the clinicians caring for the patient and obtain additional history required for the diagnosis.
  2. **Medical Knowledge:** The resident will be expected to describe basic Dermatopathology knowledge at a textbook level and basic concepts of Dermatopathology for cases they have signed out. In addition, residents are expected to do the following to increase his or her medical knowledge during their rotation in Dermatopathology:  

    1. Read and demonstrate understanding in chapters of Skin Pathology (Weedon) related to cases they have seen and other significant entities of the differential diagnosis.
    2. Read and discuss the literature for issues involving individual cases the resident has signed out.
    3. Read and discuss the literature for issues involving individual patients for which the resident has signed out cases.
    4. Attend didactic lectures, conferences, and journal clubs offered by the department.
  3. **Practice-based Learning and Improvement:** The resident will be expected to demonstrate life-long practice based learning and improvement with the following activities:  

    1. Rapidly review the literature, including the use of electronic media for anticipated difficult cases to which they are assigned to interpret.
    2. Review the literature and lead the discussion on improvement of diagnostic accuracy of basic and difficult cases.
  4. **Interpersonal and Communication Skills:** The resident will be expected to do the following to further their interpersonal and communication skills:  

    1. Competently and concisely discuss any selected patient's case with the clinician and address the clinician's concern on selected or difficult to diagnose cases.
    2. Competently and concisely discuss any selected patient's case with faculty and other residents in the department.
    3. Interact with various laboratory technicians, secretaries, and other personnel in the department to facilitate safe and efficient diagnosis and care of patients.
  5. **Professionalism:** The residents will be expected to act responsibly and with integrity to their departmental faculty, other clinicians, fellow residents, laboratory technicians, departmental secretaries, and other departmental personnel throughout their rotation. In addition, residents are expected to:  

    1. Show sensitivity and responsiveness to patients' culture, age, gender, and disabilities.
    2. Have a commitment to ethical principles including the confidentiality of patient information.
  6. **Systems-based Practice:** Residents should demonstrate an awareness of and responsiveness to the needs of the large health care system as it relates to patient care. Residents should:  

    1. Interact and participate in hospital initiatives to improve quality and efficiency in the laboratory as it relates to processing patient specimens.
    2. Discuss systems-based problems as they pertain to patient care with the individual faculty on the rotation and at any pertinent conferences held while the resident is on rotation.

#### Assessments

The following methods are used to assess the residents' achievement of
educational objectives and competencies during their rotation in
Dermatopathology:

  1. Faculty Evaluations (Patient Care, Medical Knowledge, Practice-based Learning and Improvement, Interpersonal and Communication Skills, Professionalism, Systems-based Practice).
  2. Conference and lecture attendance records (Practice-based Learning and Improvement, Interpersonal and Communication Skills, Professionalism).
  3. Case logs (Practice-based Learning and Improvement).
  4. Annual Resident In Service-Examination (Medical Knowledge).
