#  Molecular Diagnostics, Cytogenetics and Biochemical Genetics - Multi-
institutional Rotation

The mission of the resident rotation in the Genetics Laboratories is to
prepare physicians with a working knowledge of the basic science,
technologies, and organization involved in testing patients for inherited and
acquired genetic disease. This training experience will integrate the modern
methods of genetic testing into a comprehensive experience that enables a
trainee to use this knowledge in their daily practice of medicine as a
pathologist.

Genetic testing is clearly increasing in its application for the diagnosis,
prognosis and monitoring of acquired diseases (mostly premalignant and
malignant conditions), in addition to its traditional role in the work up of
constitutional disease. The field is extremely dynamic, with significant
advances in technology and rapidly increasing disease information, due in part
to advances associated with the Human Genome Project. The overall goal of the
genetics rotation is to train residents to be able to fluidly move between the
subspecialties of genetics, including cytogenetics, molecular genetics and
biochemical genetics. After completion of the rotation, a resident should are
able to:

  1. Integrate the various genetic test results with morphologic, clinical, and other relevant laboratory data to arrive at a single interpretation for diagnostic and prognostic purposes.
  2. Recognize the advantages and limitations of the different testing modalities such that they are able to help physicians to prioritize test requests and eliminate redundant testing.
  3. Acquire knowledge of how to access and utilize published literature and databases to be able to continue to integrate new findings in the genetics field into daily clinical practice.

In order to meet these overall goals, the genetics rotation includes a
combination of:

  1. Didactic lectures to provide basic theoretical and empirical knowledge about the various disease entities and genetic technologies.
  2. Dedicated time within the individual genetic laboratories to become more intimately familiar with the individual specialty tests, their applications and interpretations.
  3. Experience in collecting, coordinating and integrating testing of a given patient's specimen, interpretation and sign out of results.
  4. Experience in verbally communicating genetic testing results to referring physicians.
  5. Opportunity for performing a research project utilizing at least two of the different genetic testing methodologies.
  6. Attendance at patient related conferences to see how genetic test results are integrated into clinical care.

#### Organization of the Genetics Laboratories

The organization of the genetics laboratories is based on the perspective that
all types of genetic testing, involving the principles of cellular and
molecular genetics, are part of the oversight of these laboratories. This
perspective involves the implementation of strategies for making diagnoses for
constitutional and acquired genetic diseases through a combination of tests
that may include karyotyping, nucleic acid methods, or advanced procedures in
the biochemical analysis of clinical materials.

The Genetics Laboratories consist of the clinical laboratory sections for
Cytogenetics, Molecular Diagnostics and Biochemical Genetics

the MDL fellow and staff.

#### Overview of Daily Duties and Responsibilities

  * For those patients referred to the laboratory for gene rearrangements, BCR-ABL testing and BMT engratment studies, the resident is exected to obtain clinical histories and relevant results from other laboratories (Special Hematology, Flow Cytometry/Immunophenotyping, Surgical Pathology, Cytogenetics). This information should be obtained PRIOR to reviewing cases with staff person on service.
  * Review test results as they become available with the Molecular Diagnostics Fellow PRIOR to case sign out with the staff person on service. The resident should be prepared to answer any questions regarding any particular case.
  * Attend case sign out with staff person on service.
  * Answer clinician inquires with regard to test offerings and patient results.
  * Enter Morphologic Interpretation into Gene Rearrangement and BCR-ABL reports on the computer.
  * Perform literature searches regarding unusual/difficult cases.

  * Know specimen requirements for molecular diagnostic testing.
  * Obtain an understanding of DNA and RNA extraction
  * Understand what is involved in setting up a Southern transfer
  * Understand the polymerase chain reaction and RT-PCR.
  * Understand the basic principles of DNA sequencing.
  * Understand the basic principles of assays used in the MDL.
  * Understand basic principles of molecular biology.
  * Understand the basic principles of human genetics.
  * Understand the basic molecular pathology of those diseases commonly tested for in the clinical molecular diagnostic laboratory.
  * Understand the use of molecular testing in the diagnosis and management of disease and the relationship/overlap between molecular testing and other laboratory tests (e.g., flow cytometry, cytogenetics).
  * Understand laboratory practice issues including proficiency testing, certification, QA/QC, and medicare compliance.

#### Resident Opportunities to Function as a Consultant to Other Physicians

The residents on rotation in the molecular diagnostics laboratory are expected
to obtain relevant patient information from the referring physician. The
resident is also expected to answer quiries with regard to appropriate testing
and patient results. These interactions may include physicians from Medical
Genetics, Pediatrics, Family Practice, OB/GYN, Oncology, and BMT Clinic. The
resident is also expected to be able to discuss molecular diagnostic results
with residents, fellows and staff from other Special Diagnostics Laboratories
including Special Hematology, Cytogenetics, and Flow Cytometry.

#### Description of On-call Duties

At the present time, the resident is "on-call" in Molecular Diagnostics during
regular working hours. In an urgent situation, the resident should contact
either the supervisor or an MDL faculty member.

#### Structured Formal Education in Management of the Molecular Diagnostics
Laboratory

  * The resident is invited to attend the monthly "Special Diagnostics" Administrative Meeting
  * The resident is required to attend the weekly Molecular Diagnsotics Staff Meeting.
  * The resident participates in the sign-out of any CAP or other proficiency testing specimens which are analyzed in the laboratory during the resident's rotation.
  * While on rotation in the MDL, residents may elect to be involved in the development of a clinical assay. This project is dependent upon needs of the MDL, and is chosen at the discretion ot the laboratory staff. The rationale for the development of a particular assay is discussed with the resident.

#### Required Conferences/Seminars

  * Molecular Diagnostics Staff Meeting, Discussion of issues in laboratory management, and interesting cases in the MDL.
  * Hematologic Malignancy Conference, This meeting involves the discussion of difficult and/or unusual hematologic-malignancy cases. The meeting involves FUMC clinicians and staff from the Special Diagnsotics Laboratories.
  * Special Diagnostics Administrative Meeting, Discussion of administrative issues in the "Specialty Diagnostics" laboratories.

#### Other Conferences

  * GI Pathology Conference
  * Laboratory Medicine and Pathology Grand Rounds
  * Clinical Pathology Case Conference
  * Dermatopathology Conference
  * Cytology Conference
  * Institute of Human Genetics Seminar
  * Resident's Conference

#### Scholarly Activities/Research Activities During and After Rotation

During the rotation, residents are expected to perform literature searches
with regard to difficult/unusual cases. The findings of the literature search
are discussed with the MDL staff and fellows. The resident is also expected to
present the case and the results of the literature search at the weekly MDL
staff meeting. The MDL directors emphasize that staying current with the
literature is essential in a rapidly changing field such as molecular
diagnostics. Residents are also expected to participate in a laboratory
project. The project may be bench oriented (e.g. participation in the
development of a new laboratory protocol or technology), or library-oriented
(e.g. creation or supplementation of the Laboratory Disease Reference Book).
The scope/topic of the project will be agreed upon by the resident and the
staff. Residents who are interested in continuing work in the MDL after the
rotation period may participate in more involved development projects or in
research projects associated with molecular diagnostics. Residents who pursue
a fellowship in the MDL are expected to devote 50% of their time to
development or research activities.

#### Basis, Method and Criteria for Resident Evaluation

  * Residents will be evaluated on performance of daily activities (described previously).
  * Residents will be evaluated on participation in required meetings and conferences.
  * Residents will be evaluated on presentations to the MDL staff meeting.
  * Residents will be evaluated on participation in a laboratory project (either bench-related or library-related).

The MDL also has a teaching file of gels and autoradiograms illustrating
interesting/unusual cases. The MDL also has a Disease Reference Book including
background information, testing protocols, and result interpretation for each
of the diseases tested for in the MDL.

### Cytogenetics

The Cytogenetics rotation is aimed at providing residents with basic knowledge
in the techniques and applications of classic cytogenetics and molecular
cytogenetics, clinical indicators for evaluation of potential constitutional
or acquired chromosomal abnormalities, correct use and interpretation of
standard cytogenetic nomenclature, and interpretation of cytogenetic findings.
Emphasis will be placed on correlation of cytogenetic findings with clinical,
morphologic and other laboratory data for purposes of differential diagnosis
and prognostication.

Because of the high degree of complexity of cytogenetic testing, and the
length of time required to become proficient at identifying subtle
abnormalities in chromosome banding patterns, it is not expected that, upon
completion of the rotation, the residents will be able to independently review
and critique patients' studies. The residents will, however, have sufficient
training to identify numerical and major structural abnormalities, to
recognize the major recurring abnormalities in hematologic malignancies, solid
tumors and specific (delete word) constitutional genetic syndromes.
Additionally, the rotation requires searching of published literature so that
residents become familiar with appropriate search strategies, genetic
databases, and current data which impact the cytogenetic interpretation.

  * Learn the basics of the International System of Cytogenetic Nomenclature, 2005 (Core competency: Medical knowledge)
  * Learn to search peer-reviewed literature for updates regarding the clinical significance of cytogenetic abnormalities and for newly developed technologies (Core competencies: Medical knowledge, practice-based learning and improvement)
  * Learn to triage cases according to clinical care needs (Core competencies: Patient care, systems-based practice)
  * Learn to utilize lab resources effectively for patient care; identify studies that represent redundant testing or those which will likely not yield an informative result for patient care (Core competencies: Patient care, systems-based practice
  * Learn to communicate with Referring Physicians regarding requested testing and results of these tests (Core competencies: Patient care, interpersonal and communication skills, professionalism)
  * Learn how to read a Cytogenetics report (Core competencies: Patient care, medical knowledge)
  * Learn the basics of tissue processing for Cytogenetics, including G-banding and fluorescence in-situ hybridization (Core competencies: Medical knowledge)
  * Prepare a brief (30-minute) talk for the laboratory staff on their choice of topic (Core competencies: Interpersonal and communication skills, professionalism)

To achieve these goals, the Cytogenetics rotation will involve the following:

  1. Each morning, the Residents will review all of the new referrals to the laboratory. They will collect relevant clinician and ancillary lab data, and determine the reason for referral, the best testing methodology to apply, and triage the case. Each referral will be discussed with the Medical Director.
  2. Each day, a single current case will be identified for more extensive research and review by the Residents. These cases will be selected based on their representation of a major group of cytogenetic referrals: e.g., leukemias, lymphomas, solid tumors, etc. A few key published papers will be provided to the Residents and they will be asked to supplement these with one or more current papers from the literature. The Residents will prepare a brief write-up of the major findings in the literature to include the major cytogenetic abnormalities associated with the particular disease entity and their prognostic significance. Every one to two days during the rotation, the Medical Director will meet to discuss the case and disease entity with the Residents, including with this discussion some finalized cytogenetic reports and karyotypes.
  3. Each day during their rotation, one Resident will be assigned to review cases that may be appropriate for cancellation. He/she will review the reasons why a cancellation approval is being sought, and will make the appropriate request to the Referring Physician (after approval by the Medical Director).
  4. Each day during their rotation, one Resident will be assigned as the “go-to” person for the Cytogenetic technologists, to obtain further clinical or laboratory data that will be used to determine appropriate processing of specimens.
  5. Each day, the Residents will review cases as the Medical Director interprets and signs them out.
  6. Before the end of the rotation, each Resident will provide a brief (30-minute) talk for the laboratory staff. This talk will integrate clinical, pathologic and cytogenetic findings and will be based on a current case and review of the literature.

In order to achieve these goals, the Residents will be expected to have
regular attendance in the laboratory. If the Resident is absent for more than
one day due to illness or other excused reason, he or she will provide written
summaries of cases in lieu of oral discussion. The Residents are expected to
demonstrate and maintain a professional demeanor at all times in the clinical
laboratory.
