interest, and demonstrated excellence in the area of cytogenetics and
molecular genetics. Please provide the following application materials:

All individuals with a doctoral degree earned outside of the US, Canada or
Puerto Rico who are planning to sit for the certification examination are
strongly urged to have the ABMG Credentials Committee review their credentials
prior to the onset of medical genetics training in an ABMG-accredited
fellowship or ACGME-accredited clinical genetics residency program for
determination of equivalency of the doctoral degree. Please visit their
