Physicians interested in pursuing advanced training in laboratory medicine and
pathology will need to submit a completed
[Fellowship Application Form]({{site.baseurl}}/files/prospective_fellows/applying/Fellowship_Application_Form.pdf), a letter of inquiry and all supporting documentation indicated below. The letter of inquiry should include the name of the fellowship program and a brief overview of the applicant's interests, related prior experiences, and long-term career goals.

_Complete applications must be received no later than September 1 for
positions beginning July 1 of the following year._

Applications for the [Hematopathology Fellowship Program](../hematopathology/)
should be received no later than January 1 for positions beginning July 1 of
the following year.

[Blood Banking and Transfusion Medicine Fellowship](../blood_banking_and_transfusion_medicine/) suggests
applying early as applications are accepted on a rolling basis. The
application deadline is 03/31 for Fellowships beginning the same year.

Only complete applications are reviewed for possible interviews. Complete
applications consist of the Department's fellowship application form,
Curriculum Vitae, United States Medical Licensing Examination results (parts
1, 2, and 3), and three letters of recommendation. These letters should be
from the applicant's current/most recent program director and two other
physicians who know the applicant well. International medical graduates must
also submit a copy of their valid ECFMG certificate and be eligible for a J-1
visa, if necessary.
