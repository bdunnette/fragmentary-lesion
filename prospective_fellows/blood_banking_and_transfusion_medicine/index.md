title: Blood Banking and Transfusion Medicine Fellowship
categories: fellowships
published: true
---
This program involves the University of Minnesota Medical school, University of Minnesota Medical Center, Fairview, the Memorial Blood Centers of Minnesota, the American Red Cross North Central Blood Services of St. Paul, Hennepin County Medical Center, and the Veterans' Affairs Medical Center. This fellowship integrates the best aspects of these transfusion services and blood centers into an exceptionally balanced, yet diversified transfusion medicine experience. While rotations vary with individual trainee interests, the standard program includes: 6 months at Fairview-University, 1 month Memorial Blood Centers, 2 months American Red Cross, 6 weeks Veterans' Affairs Medical Center, and 6 weeks Hennepin County Medical Center. The fellows spend the majority of their time at their assigned institutions and participate weekly in conferences involving the entire transfusion medicine faculty. The fellowship is designed to prepare physicians for a career on either a hospital transfusion service or in a regional blood center. Substantial clinical involvement and extensive experience with laboratory problem solving and clinical consultation is provided. Complete laboratory training related areas such as immunology and coagulation is also available. As the fellow gains experience, more clinical duties and special projects are assigned. A second year of predominantly research is available for exceptional trainees.

### Teaching Facilities

University of Minnesota Medical Center, Fairview is a world leader in solid organ and hematologic stem cell transplantation and the treatment of hematological malignancies, including stem cell processing and freezing programs. The hospital has a broad range of active clinical services that extensively interact with the transfusion service, including cardiovascular surgery, obstetrics, neonatology, gynecology, and others. The Donor Center and Apheresis Unit provide peripheral blood stem cell collections, a busy therapeutic apheresis service, and carry out many developmental projects.

Memorial Blood Centers of Minnesota is an American Association of Blood Banks (AABB) Rare Donor Reference Laboratory, conducts parentage testing, performs transfusion-transmitted disease and clinical diagnostic testing for viral markers, serves as a local immunohematology reference laboratory, and provides expertise in the legal aspects of blood banking.

American Red Cross North Central Blood Services, St. Paul is a large, multi-service blood center that collects about 240,000 whole blood units annually, primarily in off-site mobile operations. The departments of hospital services and blood donor collections provide the fellow with insight into the regional management of blood resources. The blood center operates a large apheresis unit that collects products for both transfusion and research. The blood center also houses the ARC national neutrophil serology reference laboratory, a platelet cross match and platelet serology laboratory, a red cell serology laboratory, a cord blood bank, and a donor registry for the National Marrow Donor Program.

The Veterans' Affairs Medical Center provides a range of clinical services, including general and cardiovascular surgery, cancer therapy, and hematology. The fellow learns laboratory techniques directly at the bench under supervision, participates in the operation of a hospital-based blood donor program, and consults on clinical problems of transfusion medicine.

Hennepin County Medical Center provides advanced proficiency in trauma / massive transfusion practices, obstetric-associated transfusion practices, and the principles of a hospital transfusion service.

### Curriculum

The goal of the fellowship in Transfusion Medicine and Blood Banking is to provide comprehensive training in transfusion medicine, immunohematology, and blood banking. Following the fellowship, each fellow should be familiar with the basic principles of blood groups, compatibility testing, blood and blood component therapy, adverse effects of transfusion, blood donor recruitment and selection, blood collection, transmissible disease testing, apheresis including therapeutic apheresis, bone marrow and stem cell processing, parentage testing, laboratory administration, and total quality management. The fellow should have a working knowledge of the regulatory aspects involved in blood donor collection and transfusion medicine services. The fellow will obtain this comprehensive training by experience at five institutions. The material to be covered at each institution is shown in Table 1.

In general, blood donor recruitment, donor selection, blood collection (whole blood and apheresis), component production transmissible disease testing, inventory management, and the organization and management of a community blood supply system will be provided at the ARC and MBCM. The patient oriented experiences are provided at the three hospital locations which complement each other. UMMCF is an academic medical center with major programs in solid organ and hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, oncology, cardiovascular surgery, obstetrics, and a neonatal ICU. HCMC is the city county hospital that serves as the primary trauma center and provides general medical care for a diverse population with a wide variety of medical, surgical, and pediatric problems. The VAMC is a general acute care facility that provides the fellow experience in consulting and the operation of a general community hospital type facility.

At UMMC, the fellow has extensive clinical involvement with component (especially platelet) use, blood components for surgery (due to large organ transplant service), therapeutic apheresis (done by blood bank donor center) and interaction with other clinical service residents and fellows such as hematology, marrow transplant, organ transplant, pediatrics and general surgery.

At HCMC, the fellow provides medical direction to the transfusion service under the supervision of the staff. This includes attending morning rounds, following up on appropriate cases, reviewing antibody workups, reviewing platelet transfusions and evaluating transfusion reactions. The fellow will also supervise the blood and component therapy of patients undergoing massive transfusion especially in the operating rooms or the emergency department.

Although five institutions are involved, there is good coordination and integration of fellowship training. Faculty from all of the institutions attend a weekly breakfast meeting along with the fellows and other trainees assigned to the blood banks including residents, medical students, hematology/oncology fellows, etc. Interesting or difficult cases from all the five institutions are discussed along with topics of interest in blood banking and transfusion medicine.

The objectives of the Fellowship include:

- Demonstration of competency in routine hospital blood bank clinical and management decisions such as selection of blood for patients with multiple antibodies and maintaining adequate blood inventories for provided services.
- Evaluation and management of patients with disorders treated by apheresis.
- Evaluation of transfusion reactions and deviations from blood bank policy
- Selection of appropriate blood components for stem cell transplant patients in the pre- and post-transplant setting
- Selection of blood components and pharmaceuticals for patients with bleeding and/or coagulopathy
- Demonstration of knowledge of regulatory requirements mandated by the federal and state governments or non-governmental certifying agencies.
- To successfully address these objectives, the fellow will be required to demonstrate achievement in the six general competency areas. Each major rotation is specifically designed with these competency areas in mind (see individual rotation goals and objectives).
