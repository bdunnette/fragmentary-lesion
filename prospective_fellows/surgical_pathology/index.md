Established 35 years ago, this fellowship has a strong tradition of providing
education in all aspects of surgical pathology beyond residency training.
Under guidance of known experts, fellows are granted progressive autonomy.
This program prepares trainees for independent sign-out in surgical pathology
practice and focuses in important subspecialty areas. Gradual responsibility
provides opportunity for appropriately seeking consultation. State of the art
ancillary laboratories expose the fellows to new diagnostic and prognostic
studies. Interpersonal and communication abilities, supervisory and management
skills constitute essential components of this fellowship. Academic activities
are fostered; ample material, resources, and expert guidance are available for
participation in research projects.

With over 50 years' combined experience, the directors have contributed to
advances in surgical pathology. Faculty members are general surgical
pathologists with specific expertise in subspecialty areas. Collegiality and
friendly environment foster professional and personal growth.

The purpose of this fellowship is to train well rounded surgical pathologists
who will become the leaders in academia and community practice.
