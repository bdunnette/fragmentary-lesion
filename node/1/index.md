#  About Our Program

In Conjunction with its Affiliated Hospitals, the [Department of Laboratory
Medicine and Pathology](http://pathology.umn.edu) at the University of
Minnesota Offers Outstanding Graduate Medical Education to Physicians from
Around the World.

The Program's mission is to provide strong basic training in laboratory
medicine and pathology and its subspecialties, including cytogenetics,
cytopathology, hematopathology, molecular diagnostics, surgical pathology,
transfusion medicine/cellular therapy, and basic science & clinical research.

The Program's philosophic objective is to develop a sturdy medical
knowledge/skill base and professional attributes that allow a resident/fellow
to independently and competently practice pathology with a life-long
commitment to continued learning and excellence.

## Prospective Residents

The Department provides four years of combined anatomic & clinical and three
years of anatomic or clinical pathology only residency training to its
physicians-in-training who continually make successful academic progress
towards the independent practice of laboratory medicine and pathology.
