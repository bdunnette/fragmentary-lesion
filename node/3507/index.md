#  Resident Portfolio

Each resident must maintain a portfolio that serves as an archive of education
and research activities. Residents should be sure portfolios are up to date
before semi-annual meetings with the Program Director. Portfolios include
documents such as:

  * Curriculum vitae
  * Handouts prepared for conferences
  * Documentation of quality assurance activities
  * Grand Rounds presentations
  * Research proposals
  * Annual research progress reports
  * Patient presentations
  * Reprints of published scholarly work, including clinical studies, scientific articles, clinical reviews, editorials, or letter to the editor
  * Unpublished manuscripts of clinical studies, scientific articles, or clinical reviews
  * Printouts of case log from the ACGME web site
  * Evaluations of oral presentations
  * Teaching experience
  * Administrative experience, including participation in departmental/medical school/hospital committees

The following information is from the ACGME/ABMS Joint Initiative Toolbox of
Assessment Methods, Version 1.1, September 2000, page 11:

"**Description** - A portfolio is a collection of products prepared by the
resident that provides evidence of learning and achievement related to a
learning plan. A portfolio typically contains written documents but can
include video- or audio-recordings, photographs, and other forms of
information. Reflecting upon what has been learned is an important part of
constructing a portfolio. In addition to products of learning, the portfolio
can include statements about what has been learned, its application, remaining
learning needs, and how they can be met. In graduate medical education, a
portfolio might include a log of clinical procedures performed; a summary of
the research literature reviewed when selecting a treatment option; a quality
improvement project plan and report of the results; ethical dilemmas faced and
how they were handled; a computer program that tracks patient care outcomes;
or a recording or transcript of counseling provided to patients.
